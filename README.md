## Project Description

Design and implement a **Single-page application** using [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)

The application should have a:

- **public part** (accessible without authentication)
- **private part** (available for registered users)

### Public Part

The **public part** of your projects should be **visible without authentication**.
This public part could be the application start page, application statistics, the user login and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.

### Private Part (Registered users area)

**Registered users** should have personal area in the web application accessible after **successful login**.
This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.
